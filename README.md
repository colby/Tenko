**Tenko** (Japanese: 天狐) are a type of divine beast in Japanese folklore. After
reaching 1,000 years of age and gaining its ninth tail, a kitsune (fox) turns a
golden color, becoming a 'Tenko' (天狐, "heavenly fox"/"celestial fox"), the
most powerful form of the kitsune, and then ascends to the heavens. They are
able to see a thousand ri ahead (approx. 3927km or 2440 miles). They have nine
tails unlike the lower-ranked existences, the yako, the kiko, and the kūko.
