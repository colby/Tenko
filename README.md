Tenko (Japanese: 天狐) are a type of divine beast in Japanese folklore. After
reaching 1,000 years of age and gaining its ninth tail, a kitsune (fox) turns a
golden color, becoming a 'Tenko' (天狐, "heavenly fox"/"celestial fox"), the
most powerful form of the kitsune, and then ascends to the heavens. They are
able to see a thousand ri ahead (approx. 3927km or 2440 miles). They have nine
tails unlike the lower-ranked existences, the yako, the kiko, and the kūko.

Tenko are of the highest rank of foxes in the Edo period, and in the essays
"Zen'an Zuihitsu (善庵随筆)" and "Hokusō Sadan (北窓瑣談)," the foxes are
ranked in the order of tenko, kūko, kiko, and then yako. Also, in the
Nihon Shoki, in the 9th year of Emperor Jomei (637), the great shooting star
was written as 天狗 (normally read "tengu") and was given the reading of
"amatsu kitsune," and from this, the essay "Zen'an Zuihitsu" put forth the
theory that tenko and tengu are the same.
